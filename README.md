# prettier

A Highlight JS theme with support for Dark Mode. prettier is (hopefully) unique with it's different take on code blocks, as well as using more vibrant colours when highlighting code, and wide range of colours used.

## Usage

To use prettier, you need Highlight JS, and our CSS code. Place `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@11.9.0/build/highlight.min.js"></script>`, and `<script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>` at the end of your `<body>`, like so:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@11.9.0/build/highlight.min.js"></script>
    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Then, you need to reference the prettiert CSS file:

``` html

```
